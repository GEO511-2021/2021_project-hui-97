# Introduction

Jakobshavn Isbrae, one of the largest tidewater glaciers in Greenland, has been exhibiting complex spatiotemporal behaviors. After ~20 years of acceleration, retreating, and thinning, it started to decelerate, readvance, and thicken beginning in 2016. The acceleration and retreat resumed in 2019. Understanding the driving mechanisms of these changes, especially the reversal in 2016, is essential to predict its future contribution to sea-level rise under different scenarios of climate change.

Previous studies found that decreased submarine melt and extended existence of rigid melange as a result of ocean cooling near the terminus are strong candidates for causing the reversal. However, the roles of the subglacial drainage system and the atmospheric temperature remain elusive. This project aims to compare the relationships of ice surface velocity with the subglacial drainage system and air temperature to quantify their impact on the short reversal of Jakobshavn Isbrae in 2016. 

# Materials and methods

[~ 200 words]

Narrative: Clear narrative description of the data sources and methods. Includes data from at least two sources that were integrated / merged in R.

Code: The code associated with the project is well organized and easy to follow. Demonstrates mastery of R graphics and functions.

Data: The underlying data are publicly accessible via the web and downloaded/accessed within the Rmd script. If you want to use your own data, you must make it available on a website (e.g. Figshare) so that others are able to re-run your code.

You can do bullets like this:

* The first most important thing
* The second most important thing
* The third most important thing

You can do numbers like this:

1. The first most important thing
2. The second most important thing
3. The third most important thing

See [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for all the amazing things you can do.
